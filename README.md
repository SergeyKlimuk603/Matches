#Matches Game "Matches".


There are from 11 to 20 matches on the field.

The game is played against the computer. The task of the players is to remove one or two matches from the field, the one who takes the last matches wins.

The game is self-learning: it constantly analyzes the moves of a person and corrects its moves; with each round it becomes more difficult to win. For example, if you constantly play with 12 matches, then after 10 - 20 rounds it will be impossible to win against the computer.
